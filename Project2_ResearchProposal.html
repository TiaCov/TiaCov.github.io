			<h3>Project 2 - Research Proposal</h3>
			<p>The Front-End Analysis and Systems Evaluation competency is meant to provide students the ability to develop skillsets related to data collection, analysis, and evaluation as they apply to designing, developing and learning opportunities and systems.</p>
			<p>The project displayed for this competency is a full research proposal. The topic that I chose for this project attempted to answer the question of whether or not interactive learning enhances knowledge absorption and lends to desired behavioral change. This project included background research, a literature review, and a methodology section.This project meets competency 2.1 which states, “Objective 2.1: Students are able to conduct analysis in order to translate and use theoretical frameworks and existing research to design/develop learning opportunities and systems.” This competency was met as I was able to use and explain qualitative and quantitative research methods to demonstrate how they can be used to answer social science research problems. Using these methods, I was able to answer the instructor provided questions and meet the specified project requirements. Additionally, I was able to analyze and address potential ethical issues that can arise in all stages of the research process. Reflecting on the course of completing this project, I realize that I was strong in the categories included in the methodology section. However, if I were to re-do the project, I would refine my research question a bit more as there was not a surplus of existing literature on the chosen topic. I feel that with a more extensive database of literature, I would have been able to better conclude exactly “how”interactive learning impacts long-time knowledge absorption and on the job behavioral change</p>
			<p>A recap of my learning includes how to effectively choose qualitative or quantitative methods depending upon what problem you are trying to solve for, how to anticipate ethical concerns in research and, how to formulate a comprehensive research proposal.</p>
			<p>To complete this project, I relied on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, & Mixed Methods Approaches by Cresswell, JW & Creswell, J.D.</li>
				<li>Ellis Library</li>
			</ul>
