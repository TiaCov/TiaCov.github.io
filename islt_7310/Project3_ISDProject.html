            <h1>Project 3</h1>
			<h3>ISD Project</h3>
			<p>The Leadership and Social Responsibility competency aims to provide students with the ability to become socially responsible and reflective on how technology interacts with society.</p>
			<p>The project that I have included that aligns with this competency is the ISD project I helped to create alongside of my group. Our project was called Happiness and Wellness: A Self-Care Course. This project required that each team member manage certain aspects of the project, including research, the development of materials, ethical considerations, any considerations and final findings. My main role was to manage the Learner Analysis, the Contextual Analysis, and the Summative Assessment. I also served an overall editor for the project content. Through this project, we determined our ideal learners, assessed their current knowledge, determined course objectives and designed and developed materials which included assessments, surveys, PowerPoint presentations, other instructor led materials, post-learning resources and reflections</p>
			<p>I was able to meet this competency by demonstrating technology leadership and knowledge of the related ethics that had to be considered. I believe my strengths in this project were my ability to take a creative lens to designing surveys, the learner assessment, and ethical considerations. My area of opportunity is the formative evaluation. Through this project, I feel that I really strengthened my ability to effectively solve group conflicts and better assess a learnerâ€™s current knowledge.</p>
