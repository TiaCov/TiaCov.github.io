    <h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3>
<p>This site will allow you to have a bird’s eye view of some of the concepts and skillsets I have acquired while in the ISLT program in pursuit of a Master of Science degree in Learning Technologies and Design.</p>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of my portfolio is to provide a central place that I can demonstrate mastery of the learning technologies and design competencies. I consider it to be a visual representation of the collective of skillsets I have obtained and refined during the course of the master’s program. Through this presentation of content, my objectives are to: allow it to serve as a learning assessment, show skills that can immediately be utilized in real working environments, and show some of my creativity and individuality. There are three main goals this portfolio aims to accomplish:
    <ul>
        <li>First, it will demonstrate my ability to design and develop learning systems.</li>
        <li>Second, it will allow me to demonstrate my ability to assess and evaluate learning systems.</li>
        <li>Third, this portfolio will demonstrate my ability to be reflective of my project performances, challenges and the real-life skill application potential of the program’s learning concepts.</li>
    </ul>
