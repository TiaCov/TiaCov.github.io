<h3>Project 1 - Digital Media</h3>
            
<p>This project explored three types of digital media: images, audio and video. Some of the 
    learning objectives included examining the ways that digital media can be used on the 
    web and demonstrating the ability to apply digital media techniques. Though the use of 
    editing software, I was able to create a project around starting a t-shirt line that 
    encompassed all three digital media types and served to provide effective instruction for
    my peers. A recap of my learning includes: the ability to better use image and text 
    placement in images, the ability to edit audio to enhance the user experience, and the 
    ability to utilize free and paid video programs to create professional looking resources
    that complement learning. </p>
<p>Reflecting on this project, I feel that my strengths were editing images and audio. I feel 
    that my biggest area of improvement was video. Although I was able to meet the 
    requirements of the project, I feel that there were advanced techniques that I would 
    have liked to use to refine the project. However, time did not permit. Since the completion of the course, I have continued to strive to learn some advanced video 
    editing techniques and skills.</p>
    
<h4>Resources Used:</h4>

    <li>Digital Media Primer (Yue-Ling, 2015)</li>
    <li>The Non-Designer’s Design Book (Williams, 2015) </li>

<h3>Project 2 - Research Proposal</h3>
<p>The Front-End Analysis and Systems Evaluation competency is meant to provide
    students the ability to develop skillsets related to data collection, analysis, and 
    evaluation as they apply to designing, developing and learning opportunities and 
    systems.</p>

<p>The project displayed for this competency is a full research proposal. The topic that I 
    chose for this project attempted to answer the question of whether or not interactive 
    learning enhances knowledge absorption and lends to desired behavioral change. This 
    project included background research, a literature review, and a methodology section.This project meets competency 2.1 which states, “Objective 2.1: Students are able to
    conduct analysis in order to translate and use theoretical frameworks and existing 
    research to design/develop learning opportunities and systems.” This competency was
    met as I was able to use and explain qualitative and quantitative research methods to 
    demonstrate how they can be used to answer social science research problems. Using
    these methods, I was able to answer the instructor provided questions and meet the 
    specified project requirements. Additionally, I was able to analyze and address potential
    ethical issues that can arise in all stages of the research process. Reflecting on the 
    course of completing this project, I realize that I was strong in the categories included in 
    the methodology section. However, if I were to re-do the project, I would refine my 
    research question a bit more as there was not a surplus of existing literature on the 
    chosen topic. I feel that with a more extensive database of literature, I would have been 
    able to better conclude exactly “how”interactive learning impacts long-time knowledge 
    absorption and on the job behavioral change</p>

<p>A recap of my learning includes how to effectively choose qualitative or quantitative
methods depending upon what problem you are trying to solve for, how to anticipate
ethical concerns in research and, how to formulate a comprehensive research proposal.</p>

<p>To complete this project, I relied on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, & Mixed 
        Methods Approaches by Cresswell, JW & Creswell, J.D.</li>
    <li>Ellis Library</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project 3 - </h3>
<p>The Leadership and Social Responsibility competency aims to provide students with the 
    ability to become socially responsible and reflective on how technology interacts with 
    society.</p>

<p>The project that I have included that aligns with this competency is the ISD project I 
    helped to create alongside of my group. Our project was called Happiness and 
    Wellness: A Self-Care Course. This project required that each team member manage 
    certain aspects of the project, including research, the development of materials, ethical 
    considerations, any considerations and final findings. My main role was to manage the 
    Learner Analysis, the Contextual Analysis, and the Summative Assessment. I also 
    served an overall editor for the project content. Through this project, we determined our 
    ideal learners, assessed their current knowledge, determined course objectives and 
    designed and developed materials which included assessments, surveys, PowerPoint 
    presentations, other instructor led materials, post-learning resources and reflections</p>

<p>I was able to meet this competency by demonstrating technology leadership and 
    knowledge of the related ethics that had to be considered. I believe my strengths in this
    project were my ability to take a creative lens to designing surveys, the learner
    assessment, and ethical considerations. My area of opportunity is the formative
    evaluation. Through this project, I feel that I really strengthened my ability to effectively
    solve group conflicts and better assess a learner’s current knowledge. </p>
