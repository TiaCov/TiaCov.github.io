     Hi! My name is Tia Coverson. I live in Saint Louis, Mo., but I’m originally from the Dominican Republic. I spent most of my life in New York so I’m a New Yorker at heart. I’m a dog mom of two and a substitute mom for all 10 of my nieces and nephews. I am an Instructional Designer for an investment firm, but I also have a creative services business. As far as web development and application, I use drag and drop services such as Wix often but of course, the coding is already done for me. I’ve always wanted to learn coding as a compliment to the instructional design, marketing, and creative services skills I possess. My expectations for this class are to gain foundational knowledge of coding. I plan to use these skills to further customize the templates I build out. My favorite hobby is inventing and licensing.
