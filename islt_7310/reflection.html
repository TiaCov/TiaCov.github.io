        <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <h3>Program</h3>

<div>
    <p>When reflecting upon the courses included in my degree program, I can honestly say that most of the learning contained elements that I can use in my current work life. As an Instructional Designer, I am always seeking ways to not only enhance how I can provide additional services to my clients but also, how I can enhance the learner’s experience. I feel that the latter is more important. Feeling confident that I have a well-rounded arsenal of tools under my belt that I can readily access makes me feel good about the time, energy, and effort I’ve put into getting my education. I will be a life-long learner however, I feel that my degree program helped to give me a solid foundation that will help me more effectively retain knowledge of advanced techniques.</p>
</div>

    <h3>Projects</h3>

<p style = "text-indent: 30px;"> Thinking of the projects I have provided in this portfolio; I feel that the materials chosen to help compliment the learning in each course were tremendously helpful. I found that there was a plethora of “real” examples to demonstrate the learning and provide real-life application examples. Knowing exactly how I could apply course concepts in my everyday life helped me to become more invested in the courses. This meant that I actively set time aside to explore even the non-required resources.</p>
<p style = "text-indent: 30px;">Being a self-taught Instructional Designer, I sought out my degree program to gain research-based foundational knowledge. However, I also wanted to be able to focus on some of the newer learning technologies that are available such as virtual environments. Each instructor seemed to have a passion for their area of expertise which helped me to really grasp the course objectives and then, begin to brainstorm about how I can implement the skills into my current work projects. This has increased my value in the workplace and given me the ability to teach others some of the concepts I’ve learned.</p>

    <h3>Future</h3>
  
<p style = "text-align:right"; "text-indent: 30px;">I plan to continue to learn more about virtual environments and how to add more complicated video elements into my learning modules. The feedback on the related skills I have begun to apply at work has been quite positive. Learners have expressed a desire for shorter, more interactive modules that really help them to visualize their specific roles. Through my additional training, I’d like to be able to provide them with the ability to interact with an exact replica of their work environment to learn desired concepts and then, I’d like to conduct research to determine how much more effective the learning was.</p>
