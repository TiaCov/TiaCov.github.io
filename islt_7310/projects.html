			<h1>Projects Overview</h1>
			<h3>Project 1 - Digital Media</h3>
			<p>This project explored three types of digital media: images, audio and video. Some of the learning objectives included examining the ways that digital media can be used on the web and demonstrating the ability to apply digital media techniques. Though the use of editing software, I was able to create a project around starting a t-shirt line that encompassed all three digital media types and served to provide effective instruction for my peers.</p>
			
			<h3>Project 2 - Research Proposal</h3>
			<p>The Front-End Analysis and Systems Evaluation competency is meant to provide students the ability to develop skillsets related to data collection, analysis, and evaluation as they apply to designing, developing and learning opportunities and systems.</p>
			<p>The project displayed for this competency is a full research proposal. The topic that I chose for this project attempted to answer the question of whether or not interactive learning enhances knowledge absorption and lends to desired behavioral change. This project included background research, a literature review, and a methodology section.</p>
			
			<h3>Project 3 - ISD Project</h3>
			<p>The Leadership and Social Responsibility competency aims to provide students with the ability to become socially responsible and reflective on how technology interacts with society.</p>
			<p>The project that I have included that aligns with this competency is the ISD project I helped to create alongside of my group. Our project was called Happiness and Wellness: A Self-Care Course. This project required that each team member manage certain aspects of the project, including research, the development of materials, ethical considerations, any considerations and final findings.</p>
