    <h3>This is my About Me section.</h3>

    <p>Hello! My name is Tia Coverson and I enjoy <em>all</em> things creative! I get excited about taking projects from concept to completion. This passion stems from a desire to enhance and simplify the lives of those around me. I believe the roots of any successful project is communication. It’s <em>one</em> of the main reasons I pursed and completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Communications. I minored in Integrated Marketing because I feel it is important to understand how to meet audiences where there are.</p>
    <p>I also feel it is important to provide them with varying ways to meet course objectives. My degree has helped me to create <strong>user focused</strong> learning experiences. In an effort to further enhance my skills, I entered into a master’s program in Learning Technologies and Design. I expect to graduate at the end of Fall 2021.</p>
